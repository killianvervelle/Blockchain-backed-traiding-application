### E-SIGNATURE project

To integrate React with Spring Boot, we created CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. This involved setting up a data model in your Spring Boot application, creating a repository class to handle database operations, and building a REST API to expose CRUD operations.

#### Running the frontend (React)

```
cd frontend   
npm start   
```

#### Running the backend (Springboot)

#### Frontend structure

The folder has several components and pages, making the code modulable and reusable. The components are rendered at each page load. In the App.jss, the content is wrapped inside <Router> which containes <Routes>. Each Route refers to a path and renders a specific page. 

#### KYC benchmark

Company 1: iDenfy   
Facial recognition  
Document id verification   
Every KIC done even if registered user.   
Irland Dublin - stored cloud AWS   
All data sent back, invariant price.   
Json format   
Pricing: pay for approval only, so if person rejected, not charged. Good for bad user base.   
Include the KIC inside our pricing.   
3 packages: startup, silver, gold   
Price varies over number of requests.   
Paid in 1 settlement, if request exceeds the forecasted volume, adds credit for the following year.  
Same price for full integration or API   
Need to take picture by camera, so hologram/fraud proofness.
